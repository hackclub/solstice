# solstice
Chicago days of service!

## PCB Design
We wanted to create a PCB design that celebrated the coming of the summer solstice and the light of possibility for women and nonbinaries in all things programming! We designed the schematic and board using EasyEDA and exported our circuit boards to JLPCB for manufacturing. These PCBs would be gifts for the dinner guests and organizers. However, we were unable to get the PCBs made in time for the event. We were able to get one prototype built as proof of concept and used NFC tag writer to prompt a contact information form when scanned. This circuit builds of the design of the Harvest PCB, similarly addressing the issue of ‘networking acrobatics’. Our dinner guests were able to share their contact information with us so that we could easily have their personal PCBs delivered them after the event.
