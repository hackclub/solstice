## Our Workshops
### PCB
In this workshop, students learned about printed circuit boards, or PCBs. They were able to use EasyEDA to create a printed circuit board with an LED, battery, and switch, as well as add their own shapes and designs!

## Our Dinner
The night before our hackathon, we had an inspirational dinner with a few fantastic women in tech. The dinner was held at the Siena Tavern, located in the Magnificent Mile area of Chicago. We hosted 7 Hack Club girls, 3 women in tech, and 1 staff member.

We were able to learn more about each of our guests' experiences as a woman in tech, learn about how they became interested in their specialties in tech, and hear their thoughts on keeping up with new technologies and trends. A special thank you to our guests: Brianne Caplan, Lisset Rico, and Jenni Munoz! Each of them was generous in sharing and inspiring our Hack Club members.

One thing that really resonated with us was the need for more diverse perspectives in the tech industry. Our discussion focused on how we, as individuals and as a group, can focus on using tech for good. We took this lesson with us to inspire our students at the Solstice Hackathon!
